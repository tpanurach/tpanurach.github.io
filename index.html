								I'm a fourth year PhD student at Michigan State University working with Profs. <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/strader/">Jay Strader</a> and <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/chomiuk/">Laura Chomiuk</a> on accreting low-mass X-ray binairies in Galactic globular clusters. As an undergraduate, I was an <a href="https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/"> AstroCom NYC fellow</a> at The City University of New York at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History where I worked on blue stragglers. When I'm not mulling over the universe, I like to annoy my dogs and play roller derby.

								My work involves radio and X-ray observations of accreting low-mass X-ray binary systems in Galactic globular clusters to understand the coupling behaviors of their jet and accretion disk. <br><br><b> Here is the link to my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=panurach%2C%20teresa&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">publications</a>!</b>

							<h3>Bright Accreting Neutron Stars</h3>

								<figcaption><center>Artistic rendition of a low-mass X-ray binary by Rob Hynes.</center></figcaption>
							</span>
							<br>
							We analyze simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of eight bright accreting neutron stars to get an insight on the relationship between accretion inflow and jet/outflow. We find that these sources do follow the standard behaviors of accreting neutron star low-mass X-ray binariess, but with greater extremes of luminous radio emission and constraining upper limits. This work is currently submitted to the Astrophysical Journal.

							The Milky-way ATCA VLA Exploration of Radio-sources In Clusters (MAVERIC) Survey is a radio survey compromising of observing 50 nearby globular clusters (within <9kpc) for accreting compact objects.

								In my experiences, I have made it my ethical duty to foster a community for inclusiveness and collaboration amongst other undergraduate and graduate students. I have experience in creating professional development workshops and managing undergraduate research programs. Here are some of the work I have done:<br><br>
								<b>"How to Have a Productive Meeting with Your Mentor" Workshop</b><br>
								<i>Offered students effective strategies in order to understand their own career and personal goals, take control of their research experience, and achieve optimal success in their mentoring relationships.</i><br><br>
								<b>Director of Physics and Astronomy Research Experiences for <a href="https://drewscholars.natsci.msu.edu">Drew Scholars</a> (PAREDS)<br></b>
								<i>Provided career guidence and research oppurtunities with faculty for historically underrepresented astronomy undergraduates at Michigan State.</i><br><br>
								<b>Mentor for the <a href="https://astro.natsci.msu.edu/personal-and-professional-support/stellar-mentorship-program/">Stellar Mentorship Program</a></b><br>
								<i>Career mentor for junior graduate students</i><br><br>
