								<!-- Items contained in <b> tags are bolded! -->
								I am currently the executive director of the NoVEL Cosortium, a program dedicated to provide students from three HBCUs: Norfolk State University, Virginia State University, and Elizabeth City State University with professional development skills and research oppurtunities through areas of materials science and photonics.
								<br><br>
								My research focuses on analyzing the physical behaviors of accreting neutron stars using radio telescopes. I recieved my PhD in Astrophysics and Astronomy from Michigan State University in 2023 and my Bachelor of Arts in physics from the City University of New York at Hunter College in 2018.

							 Accretion and astrophysical jets are ubiquitous in compact objects (e.g. black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs). However, our knowledge of how accretion gives rise to the launching of jets is severely limited. My main research goal is to better understand this coupling relationship and what environments are needed to launch and impact jet behaviors using multiwavelength space and ground based observatories.  Here is the link to my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=panurach%2C%20teresa&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">publications</a>!</b> </p>
							<h3>Bright Accreting Neutron Stars</h3>

							<br>
							We analyze quasi/strictly-simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of eight bright accreting neutron stars (six persistenly accreting and two transients) to get an insight on the relationship between accretion inflow and jet/outflow. We find that these sources do follow the standard behaviors of accreting neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, but with greater extremes of luminous radio emission. This work is currently accepted and published (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2c6b">Panurach et al. 2021, ApJ, 923, 88 </a>). We also did a follow up study on X1850-087 after showing unusual radio varability published in <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acc4bf">Panurach et al. 2023, ApJ, 946, 88</a>.

							The Milky-way ATCA VLA Exploration of Radio-sources In Clusters (MAVERIC) Survey is a radio survey compromising of observing 50 nearby globular clusters (within <9kpc) for accreting compact objects. Our work will allow us to differentiate accreting neutron stars from black holes, and provide the best constraints on the population of black holes in Galactic globular clusters.

							</span>
							<br>
							We conducted the first radio comprehensive study of seven confirmed neutron star uUltraluminous X-ray sources using new and archival data from the VLA and ATCA to access if neutron stars could be misidentified to be radio/X-ray intermediate mass black holes canidates. We do not detect a significant radio counterpart to any extragalactic neutron star ultraluminious X-ray sources and urge extreme caution when using the radio/X-ray correlation plane to determine the nature of super-Eddington accretors (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad8b9c">Panurach et al. 2024, ApJ, 977, 2 </a>).

								In 2020, along with Profs. Laura Chomiuk, Paul Guèye and I founded PAREDS (Physics and Astronomy Research Experiences for <a href="https://drewscholars.natsci.msu.edu">Drew Scholars</a>), which provides career guidence, professional development workshops, and paid research oppurtunities with Michigan State faculty and scientists for historically underrepresented astronomy undergraduates.
								<br><br>
								My personal responsibilities as co-director is to match students with mentors that fit their research interests, organize weekly summer professional development workshops, promote peer relationships within their cohort, and participate in bi-weekly leadership meetings.  
								<br><br>
								I am now the executive director of the NoVEL Consortium at Norfolk State University. To learn more about what we do, please visit our <a href="https://www.nsu.edu/novel/">website</a>.

								In 2023, Dr. Kristen Dage and I recieved funding from the <a href="https://lsstdiscoveryalliance.org/programs/inclusive-collaboration-initiatives/projects/">LSST Discovery Alliance Inclusive Collaboration</a> to develop and create resources how LSST scientists can actively engage with students from under-resourced institutions, such as community colleges.
