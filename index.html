								I'm a fourth year PhD candidate at Michigan State University working with Profs. <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/strader/">Jay Strader</a> and <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/chomiuk/">Laura Chomiuk</a> on accreting low-mass X-ray binairies in Galactic globular clusters. As an undergraduate, I was an <a href="https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/"> AstroCom NYC fellow</a> at The City University of New York at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History where I worked on blue stragglers. When I'm not mulling over the universe, I like to annoy my dogs and read.

								My work involves radio and X-ray observations of accreting low-mass X-ray binary systems in Galactic globular clusters to understand the coupling behaviors of their jet and accretion disk. Here is the link to my <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=panurach%2C%20teresa&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">publications</a>!</b>

							<h3>Bright Accreting Neutron Stars</h3>

							</span>
							<br>
							We analyze simultaneous radio and X-ray observations of eight bright accreting neutron stars to get an insight on the relationship between accretion inflow and jet/outflow. We find that these sources do follow the standard behaviors of accreting neutron star low-mass X-ray binariess, but with greater extremes of luminous radio emission and constraining upper limits. This work is currently submitted to the Astrophysical Journal.

							<h3>The MAVERIC Survey</h3>

							</span>
							<br>
							The Milky-way ATCA VLA Exploration of Radio-sources In Clusters (MAVERIC) Survey is a radio survey compromising of observing 50 nearby globular clusters (within <9kpc) for accreting compact objects. Our work will allow us to differentiate accreting neutron stars from black holes, and provide the best constraints on the population of black holes in Galactic globular clusters.

							<p>
								In 2020, along with Profs. Laura Chomiuk, Paul Gu√®ye and I founded PAREDS (Physics and Astronomy Research Experiences for <a href="https://drewscholars.natsci.msu.edu">Drew Scholars</a>), which provides career guidence, professional development workshops, and paid research oppurtunities with Michigan State faculty and scientists for historically underrepresented astronomy undergraduates.
								<br><br>
								My personal responsibilities as co-director is to match students with mentors that fit their research interests, organize weekly summer professional development workshops, promote peer relationships within their cohort, and participate in bi-weekly leadership meetings.
