								I'm a fourth year PhD student at Michigan State University working with Profs. <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/strader/">Jay Strader</a> and <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/chomiuk/">Laura Chomiuk</a> on accreting low-mass X-ray binairies in Galactic globular clusters. As an undergraduate, I was an <a href="https://cunyastro.org/astrocom/"> AstroCom NYC fellow</a> at The City University of New York at Hunter College and the American Museum of Natural History where I worked on blue stragglers. When I'm not mulling over the universe, I like to annoy my dogs and play roller derby.

								I'm an observational astronomer intrested in accreting binary systems with compact objects -- primarily in globular clusters.  
								I'm currently working on analyzing the radio and X-ray properties of persistently accreting neutron star X-ray binaries to understand the coupling behaviors of their accretion disk and jet.

								Because of my own experiences, I have made it my ethical duty to foster a community for inclusiveness and collaboration amongst other undergraduate and graduate students. Here are some of the things I have done:<br><br>
								<b>"How to Have a Productive Meeting with Your Mentor" Workshop</b><br>
								<i>Offered students effective strategies in order to understand their own career and personal goals, take control of their research experience, and achieve optimal success in their mentoring relationships.<br><br>
								<b>Michigan State Chapter Leader of the National Astronomy Consortium (<a href="https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/student-programs/nac">NAC</a>)<br></b>
								<i>Led by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory to increase and retain the number of historically underrepresented students through research and career mentorship.</i><br><br>
								<b><a href="https://astro.natsci.msu.edu/personal-and-professional-support/stellar-mentorship-program/">Stellar Mentorship Program</a></b><br>
								<i>Career mentor for junior graduate and undergraduate students</i><br><br>
								<b>Astronomy Career and Research Advisor for Michigan State's <a href="https://drewscholars.natsci.msu.edu/">Charles Drew Science Scholars</a></b><br>
								<i>Provided career guidence and research oppurtunities with faculty for historically underrepresented astronomy undergraduates.</i>
